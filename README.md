# Digitizing 3D Humans - Client

This is a client (front-end) for the project.

## Requirements:

* CMake (I've used 3.9.1)
* OpenCV (3.4)
* Freenect2 (0.2.0)
* GLFW (3.3.0)

## Optional:

* CUDA Toolkit - I've used 9.1 but I think arbitrary one can be chosen.

## Compilation:

```
cmake .
make
make install
```
